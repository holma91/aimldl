## Why?

The ML dev workflow sucks ass. All the cloud environments are pretty bad (especially colab).

## Goal

Make the ML workflow as close to a classic SWE workflow as possible. 
I want to do as much development locally as possible, so what I need are some GPUs in the cloud where I can train models. Then I just export the models and tinker with them locally.
