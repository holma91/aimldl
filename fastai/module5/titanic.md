Build a predictive model that answers the question: â€œ
- what sorts of people were more likely to survive?
using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).

study the "data dictionary" on kaggle


We have tabular data (data is in the form of a table -> use DataFrame)

Do something about N/A values. (fill them with the mode or mean or 0 or whatever)


take the logarithm on columns with a long tail distro. log(0) = inf so we often need to add one to every value in the column.


replace non-numeric fields with numbers. create dummy variables?


create independent and dependent variables. Both should be pytorch tensors.

create a random coefficient for each column in the independent tensors. guess these coefficients are the weights?

we see that one column have much bigger values than the rest, which is a problem. make all columns contain numbers between 0 and 1.


multiply the weights with the independent variables, sum it along axis 1 and there we have our first predictions.
the sum of the values in a row in the product is a prediction.

create a loss function

split the data into training and validation sets
